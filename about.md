I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology](https://max.mpg.de/sites/ice/Pages/WelcomePage_EN.aspx) in Jena, Germany.

I specialize in archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data science. My research involves long-term human-environment interaction and [``Extreme Events''](https://www.shh.mpg.de/1437297/extreme_events).
