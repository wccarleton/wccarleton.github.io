I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology](https://www.ice.mpg.de/ext/index.php?id=extreme-events) in Jena, Germany.

I specialize in archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data science. My research involves long-term human-environment interaction and ["Extreme Events"](https://www.shh.mpg.de/1437297/extreme_events).
