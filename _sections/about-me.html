<p>Currently I'm a postdoc in the Department of <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/archaeology/faculty/carleton.html">Archaeology at Simon Fraser University</a>---though, I'm about to take up a new postdoc position at the <a href="https://www.mpg.de/155410/chemische_oekologie">Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology</a> in Jenax, Germany. My primary research focuses on the long-term impacts of climate change on humans and I use the archaeological record as a source for case studies. A significant part of this research involves developing advanced statistical tools that will allow archaeologists to test hypotheses about humanâ€“environment interaction using the palaeoenvironmental and archaeological data. I have an MA in Anthropology from Trent University in Ontario and a BA in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology from the University of Saskatchewan. I have been involved in academic fieldwork in Saskatchewan, Turkey, and Belize; and I spent two years working in Cultural Resource Management in Northeastern BC.</p>
